TicTacToe
===========

A perfect Tic Tac Toe player using the strategy in Newell and Simon's 1972 tic-tac-toe program (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy).

Feel free to play around with the code and let me know if there are bugs.

To run the game:
```shell
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

The code is finished in less than three hours, so there are a lot of if/else statment and not perfectly structured. So feel free to fork/modify the code.
